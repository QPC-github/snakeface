Getting Started
===============

Snakeface stands for "Snakemake Interface," and it's exactly that - an interface
for you to easily run and interact with Snakemake workflows.
Although it is still in development, the overarching goal is to be flexible to different needs for your deployment.
This means that you can both run it quickly as a notebook to test a workflow locally,
or deploy it in a cluster environment for your user base. If you have a need
for deployment that is not addressed here, please `let us know <https://github.com/snakemake/snakeface/issues>`_
We recommend that you start by setting up the :ref:`getting_started-example-workflow`.
