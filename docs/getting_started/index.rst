Getting Started
===============

Snakeface is intended to be flexible to different needs for your deployment.
This means that you can both run it quickly locally to test a workflow,
or deploy it in a cluster environment for your user base. If you have a need

We recommend that you start by setting up the (:ref:`getting_started-example-workflow`)
