Snakeface is intended to be flexible to different needs for your deployment.
This means that you can both run it quickly as a notebook :ref:`getting_started-notebook` to test a workflow,
or deploy it in a cluster environment for your user base. If you have a need
for deployment that is not addressed here, please `let us know <https://github.com/snakemake/snakeface/issues>`_
